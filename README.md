# Bioinformatics-for-One-Health-Pathogen-Genomics
Bioinformatics for One Health Pathogen Genomics is a practical training course designed to build capacity in the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and genomic analysis for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and outbreak investigations. With the increasing availability of sequencing technologies and open-access bioinformatics tools, this course empowers participants especially those working in low-resource or cross-sectoral settings to analyze and interpret genomic data from clinical, environmental, and foodborne pathogens. Through a One Health lens, participants will explore the principles of pathogen genomics, molecular diagnostics, and metagenomics, while gaining hands-on experience with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data analysis from short- and long-reads sequencing data, resistance gene detection, and phylogenomic interpretation. Real-world case studies, including outbreak scenarios, provide applied learning opportunities to bridge genomics and public health decision-making.
